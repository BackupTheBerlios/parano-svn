- correct mime type installation
- pause button.
- remove doesn't work.
- save current folder.
- make possible to launch parano with multiples hashfiles to check, merge the list.
  at saving, obviously we save to just one file...
  and the same with dropping files list
- we may want to insert more than one folder :)
- use gnome vfs
- redo the save system, current is broken when you don't want the sum to be in the same tree
- glade wrapper
- better progress
- hash not generated after one generation
  (save md5, then sfv...)
- drag&drop from nautilus
- when dropping a hashfile, we want to verify it, not add it
- verify if we ask for saving when we load a new hashfile
